# refugeepaths

The goal of refugeepaths is to provide an interface to usable refugee pathway data provided by the United Nations. refugeepaths is an analysis package that both provides helper functions and showcases analysis of this relational data. There is a shiny app file in the repo that also relies on this data which can be downloaded or accessed at: https://james-monks.shinyapps.io/Major_Refugee_Pathways/.
