# refugeepaths

The goal of refugeepaths is to provide an interface to usable refugee pathway data provided by the United Nations. It will provide helper functions along with showcasing analysis of this relational data. There is a shiny app file in the repo that also relies on this data which can be downloaded or accessed at: https://james-monks.shinyapps.io/Major_Refugee_Pathways/.
